## üéâ Show Description

When outlining the topics for the Major Breakthroughs Podcast's episode, my primary focus was to provide comprehensive insights into the Computer Information Systems (CIS) department. The goal is to dissect the distinctions among its four major offerings and illuminate how each diverges from the others. Many students enter college with a predetermined interest in computer science, often unaware of the alternative majors available within the field that might better align with their career objectives so my episode aims to serve as an educational resource for students navigating their academic choices. Beyond this, I also want my episode to feature firsthand experiences from students that also have been on the same boat as them and talk about how they adjusted to this change.

Given the breadth of content in the initial concept, I've opted for a structured approach with a potential span of 5 to 6 episodes. For my first episode, the focus will be on providing viewers with an overview of the computer science department and its various majors. A current student will join the podcast to discuss their motivations for selecting computer science as their major, as well as any minors they may have chosen. Moreover, I would like to introduce the struggles they may face while taking up the major and how they get through it. My first episode should also consist an introduction to the department aswell which can help students familiarize with the faculty and understand the CIS department works.

It might be hard to unpack the introduction in one whole episode so I am considering having this whole episode to flow by as a conversation with my guest. I would ask my guest a set of questions about the department and how many majors there are and what made them choose the specific major they chose in CIS. To attract more viewers, I'm planning on having a having a powerful question/ statement land in the start of my episode so that it can capture my viewers' attention. Lastly, I will do alot more planning on the contents I want and how I can fully convey what I want to without taking up too much time (more than 15 minutes) which is why I will need to be very specific with my questions.

## üì¢ Call to Action

* **Call to Action**: After listening to this audio, I want students to know if the majors offered in CIS are the right ones for them and to be able to be confident in the reason why they chose this major if they chose to do so. Students should also be able to know if the major they will be choosing in CIS actually aligns with their future career goals and aspirations.
