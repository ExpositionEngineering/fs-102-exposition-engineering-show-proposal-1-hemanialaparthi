## 🏁 One Sentence Pitch

My first episode consists of the introduction to the Computer Science department at Allegheny and the types of majors offered here and how they differ from each other.s

## 🔬 Show Details

- **Title**: Miles/ (Any other computer science students) on Computer Science
- **Host**: Me
- **Guest**: Miles/ (Any other computer science students)

## 📝 Show Objectives

- **Objective One**: Helping students figure out the differences between the majors in the CIS department
- **Objective Two**: Help find the right major for †hem and the future aspects of that certain major
- **Objective Three**: Finding good major/minor combinations with major science

## 📚 Sample Questions

Provide a list of of at least three sample questions that the host will
ask the guest.

Provide a justification for why asking this question will achieve one of
the stated objectives for the podcast episode.

- **Question One**: Coming into college, what major did you initially decide on?
- **Question Two**: What made you choose (***the specific major in CIS they are in***) as your major?
- **Question Three**: What is your major/minor combination? What are common combinations you see? Was it hard to decide on a minor?

- **Justification for Question One**: Being able to let students know that it is completely alright for students to come in not knowing what they want to major in and also being able to change their mind later on.
- **Justification for Question Two**: Help students understand what drives individuals to think academically and professionally.
- **Justification for Question Three**: Understand combinations that students can possibly do with computer science and explore other possible combinations students do.

## 🎉 Show Description

TODO: Write at least three to five paragraphs that describe the content of the
episode, ensuring that the description is both engaging and informative.

## 📢 Call to Action

After listening to this audio, I want students to know if the majors offered in CIS are the right ones for them and to be able to be confident in the reason why they chose this major if they chose to do so. Students should be able to know if the major they will be choosing in CIS actually aligns with their future career goals and aspirations.
