while completing the project.

## üèÅ One Sentence Pitch

My first episode consists of the introduction to the Computer Science department at Allegheny and the types of majors offered here and how they differ from each other.s

## üî¨ Show Details

- **Title**: Miles/ (Any other computer science students) on Computer Science
- **Host**: Me
- **Guest**: Miles/ (Any other computer science students)

## üìù Show Objectives

- **Objective One**: Helping students figure out the differences between the majors in the CIS department
- **Objective Two**: Help find the right major for ‚Ä†hem and the future aspects of that certain major
- **Objective Three**: Finding good major/minor combinations with major science

## üìö Sample Questions

Provide a list of of at least three sample questions that the host will
ask the guest.

Provide a justification for why asking this question will achieve one of
the stated objectives for the podcast episode.

- **Question One**: Coming into college, what major did you initially decide on?
- **Question Two**: What made you choose (***the specific major in CIS they are in***) as your major?
- **Question Three**: What is your major/minor combination? What are common combinations you see? Was it hard to decide on a minor?

- **Justification for Question One**: Being able to let students know that it is completely alright for students to come in not knowing what they want to major in and also being able to change their mind later on.
- **Justification for Question Two**: Help students understand what drives individuals to think academically and professionally.
- **Justification for Question Three**: Understand combinations that students can possibly do with computer science and explore other possible combinations students do.

## üéâ Show Description

Write at least three to five paragraphs that describe the content of the
episode, ensuring that the description is both engaging and informative.

When I initially started planning out the topic I wanted to talk about in the Major Breakthroughs Podcast, I wanted to really dedicate my time into framing my ideas within the CIS department and how each of the 4 majors are different from each other. I wanted to talk about how different each major is and how a student can find out the 'right' major for them. Some students might come into college wanting to major in computer science and not know about the different majors that are related to computer science which might align with their career goals more than computer science does. This is why I also want to include what it is like to adapt to major changes and bring in students who are in the same boat and let them talk about how they coped with it.

Since there is alot to unpack in initial idea, I decided that I could have up to 5-6 episodes because of how broad my idea is going to be. This is why for the first episode, I would like to introduce the viewers to the computer science department and majors and have a current student on my podcast talk about their reason for choosing computer science and what their major/minor combinations are. Additionally, I would like to introduce the struggles they face 

## üì¢ Call to Action

After listening to this audio, I want students to know if the majors offered in CIS are the right ones for them and to be able to be confident in the reason why they chose this major if they chose to do so. Students should also be able to know if the major they will be choosing in CIS actually aligns with their future career goals and aspirations.
